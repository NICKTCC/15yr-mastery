# ðŸ’» My first Console

This is my first beginner python project - a simple console app that:

- Prints a custom banner
- Displays a favourite quote
- Includes some ASCII art for fun

The goal was to practise basic syntax like:

- 'print()' statements
- Escape characters (e.g., '\\', '\n' '\t')
- Organizing output in a readable way
